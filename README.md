Analyzing global CO2 data and Canadian forest fire data utilizing datasets from the Government of Canada and from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

With the consistent increase in the CO2 concentration every year, it is shown that the number of forest fires and area burned is also rising, except in a few cases such as the early 2000s and 2020. There was a global shutdown in 2020 due to the pandemic which led to the highest decrease in CO2 emissions in the last century. In the late 1990s - 2009, there was a global crisis in which the production of coal in Russia was significantly decreased. Both of these cases prove that the fires occuring are directly linked to the global CO2 emissions.
